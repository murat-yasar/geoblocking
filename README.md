Sitepackage for the project "geoblocking"
==============================================================

## Description:

The Geoblocking extension for TYPO3 enhances your website's security and compliance by controlling access to content based on the user's geographical location. Utilizing IP detection, this extension identifies the visitor's country and either allows or restricts access to specified content for users from unauthorized regions. This is particularly useful for ensuring regulatory compliance, protecting sensitive information, or tailoring content availability according to geographic policies.

## Key Features:

**IP Geolocation**: Accurately detects the user's location based on their IP address.

**Country-Based Rules**: Easily configure which countries are authorized or unauthorized to access specific content.

**Customizable Restrictions**: Apply geoblocking rules to pages, sections, or individual content elements.

**Seamless Integration**: Compatible with existing TYPO3 sites, ensuring minimal impact on performance and user experience.

**User Notifications**: Display customizable messages to users from blocked regions, informing them of the content restrictions.


Enhance your website's control and compliance with the TYPO3 Geoblocking extension, ensuring content is accessed only by authorized users from designated countries.
